# Handwriting-recognizer
This is a basic hand writing recognizer application built using R programming.
In this I have just taken single character image dataset of MNIST and trained the model
Futher more I am trying to use this model to predict words and setences with this base model

File Description:
1. digitRecognizer.R - consists of the business logic
2. displayImages.R - consists code to convert the csv file of the dataset into image
